# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive API Documentation with Docusaurus

## Project Overview

Create a comprehensive, professional API documentation website using Docusaurus for the ageSchemaClient library. This documentation will serve as the definitive resource for developers working with Apache AGE graph databases through our TypeScript library.

## Background & Context

The ageSchemaClient library is a sophisticated TypeScript library for Apache AGE graph databases that has evolved through multiple iterations and false starts, particularly around parameter passing to AGE queries. The library now uses a robust temporary table approach to overcome Apache AGE's limitations with dynamic parameters.

### Key Historical Challenges Overcome:
1. **Parameter Passing False Starts**: Multiple attempts to use standard SQL parameter binding with Apache AGE's cypher() function failed due to AGE's limitation that the third parameter only works with literal strings, not dynamic values
2. **AGE-Specific Limitations**: Discovered that agtype only works with literal strings, not dynamic strings, requiring innovative solutions
3. **Search Path Issues**: Resolved complex issues with ag_catalog search path requirements for UNWIND operations
4. **Connection Pool Complexity**: Developed extensible connection pool system supporting multiple PostgreSQL extensions

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Create a modern, searchable, and comprehensive API documentation website using Docusaurus
2. Document the library's journey including false starts and solutions to help future developers
3. Provide practical how-to guides for common graph database tasks
4. Include automated documentation building and deployment via GitHub Actions
5. Transform existing markdown documentation into a cohesive, navigable website

### Secondary Goals
1. Establish documentation standards for future library updates
2. Create templates for common relationship patterns (parent-child, product-part, one-to-many)
3. Provide bulk loading format examples for various relationship types
4. Include performance optimization guides and troubleshooting sections

## Target Audience
