# TypeScript ageSchemaClient Library

## Project Overview
The TypeScript ageSchemaClient library is a type-safe client for working with Apache AGE graph databases. It provides a schema-aware approach to graph database operations, allowing developers to define graph schemas and use them to validate and optimize database operations. This library will be built using TypeScript, pnpm, Vite, and ViteTest.

## Objectives
1. Create a TypeScript implementation of the ageSchemaClient library
2. Provide type-safe APIs for graph database operations
3. Support schema validation and generation
4. Generate optimized SQL for batch operations
5. Implement fluent query builders for common graph operations
6. Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
7. Ensure high test coverage using ViteTest

## Key Features

### Schema Management
- Parse and validate JSON schema definitions for graph domains
- Support schema versioning and evolution
- Provide type definitions for schema components
- Implement schema inheritance and composition
- Create utility functions for schema traversal

### SQL Generation
- Generate label-specific filter functions for vertices and edges
- Generate data access functions to expose temp table data to Cypher queries
- Generate domain-specific upload functions
- Support handling of null values using SET statements
- Implement transaction handling
- Create utility functions for SQL generation

### Database Connectivity
- Implement connection management
- Create transaction handling
- Implement query execution
- Add support for parameterized queries
- Implement error handling and retries
- Create connection pooling
- Support multiple database drivers

### Fluent Query Builders
- Create type-safe, fluent APIs for building Cypher queries
- Leverage schema information to provide auto-completion and validation
- Support common graph query patterns (path finding, traversal, aggregation)
- Handle complex query conditions and projections
- Generate optimized Cypher queries
- Provide proper error handling and validation

### Documentation
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Develop getting started guides
- Create usage examples
- Write schema definition guides
- Create troubleshooting guides
- Document best practices
- Create API reference
- Write migration guides for future versions

## Technical Requirements
- TypeScript 5.0+
- pnpm for package management
- Vite for building and bundling
- ViteTest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- JSDoc for documentation
- Support for both ESM and CommonJS modules
- Support for Node.js and browser environments
- Minimum TypeScript version: 4.7

## Implementation Approach
1. Set up project structure with TypeScript, pnpm, Vite, and ViteTest
2. Implement core schema parsing and validation
3. Develop SQL generation modules
4. Create database connectivity layer
5. Implement fluent query builders
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Create documentation and examples

## Deliverables
1. TypeScript ageSchemaClient library source code
2. Comprehensive test suite
3. API documentation
4. Usage examples
5. Getting started guide
6. Schema definition guide
7. Troubleshooting guide
8. Best practices guide

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Project setup and core schema parsing (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: SQL generation and database connectivity (3 weeks)
- Phase 3: Fluent query builders (3 weeks)
- Phase 4: Testing and documentation (2 weeks)

## Success Criteria
- Library provides type-safe APIs for graph database operations
- Schema validation and generation work correctly
- SQL generation produces optimized queries
- Fluent query builders support common graph operations
- Test coverage is at least 80%
- Documentation is comprehensive and accessible
- Library works in both Node.js and browser environments
- Performance is comparable to or better than the JavaScript version
