# Welcome to ageSchemaClient Documentation

**ageSchemaClient** is a comprehensive TypeScript library for Apache AGE graph databases with schema validation, query building, and advanced data loading capabilities.

## What is ageSchemaClient?

ageSchemaClient provides a robust, type-safe interface for working with Apache AGE graph databases. It solves the historical challenges of working with AGE by providing:

- **Type-safe query building** with full TypeScript support
- **Schema validation** for vertices and edges
- **Batch loading capabilities** for efficient data import
- **Connection pool management** with proper resource handling
- **Extension system** for custom functionality

## Key Features

### üîß Query Builder
Build complex Cypher queries with a fluent, type-safe API that handles parameter management automatically.

### üìä Schema Validation
Define and validate graph schemas with comprehensive error reporting and migration support.

### ‚ö° Batch Operations
Efficiently load large datasets with optimized batch processing and progress reporting.

### üîå Extension System
Extend functionality with custom plugins and integrations.

### üõ°Ô∏è Type Safety
Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions and IntelliSense support.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install age-schema-client
```

```typescript
import { AgeSchemaClient } from 'age-schema-client';

const client = new AgeSchemaClient({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'your_database',
  user: 'your_user',
  password: 'your_password'
});

// Create a simple query
const result = await client.query()
  .match('(p:Person)')
  .where({ name: 'John' })
  .return('p')
  .execute();
```

## Why ageSchemaClient?

Apache AGE is a powerful graph database extension for PostgreSQL, but working with it directly can be challenging:

- **Parameter handling** - AGE has limitations with dynamic parameters
- **Type safety** - Raw Cypher queries lack compile-time validation
- **Connection management** - Proper resource handling requires careful setup
- **Batch operations** - Efficient data loading needs specialized approaches

ageSchemaClient addresses all these challenges while maintaining the full power of Apache AGE.
