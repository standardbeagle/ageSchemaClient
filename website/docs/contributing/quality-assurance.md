## Testing Procedures

### Functional Testing

#### Documentation Build Testing
```bash
# Test local development build
pnpm docs:start
# Verify: Site loads without errors, navigation works

# Test production build
pnpm docs:build
# Verify: Build completes without errors or warnings

# Test API documentation generation
pnpm docs:api
# Verify: API docs generate correctly, no TypeScript errors
```

#### Link Testing
```bash
# Install link checker
npm install -g markdown-link-check

# Check all documentation files
find docs -name "*.md" -exec markdown-link-check {} \;

# Check specific file
markdown-link-check docs/contributing/README.md
```

#### Code Example Testing
```bash
# Create test environment
mkdir doc-test && cd doc-test
npm init -y
npm install age-schema-client

# Test each code example
# Copy example code to test file and run
node test-example.js
```

### User Testing
