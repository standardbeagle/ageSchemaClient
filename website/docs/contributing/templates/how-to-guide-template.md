## Complete Example

Here's the complete, working code that accomplishes the task:

```typescript
import {
  PgConnectionManager,
  QueryExecutor,
  VertexOperations,
  // Other required imports
} from 'age-schema-client';

async function accomplishTask() {
  // Setup

    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5432,
    database: 'postgres',
    user: 'postgres',
    password: 'postgres'
  });

  const connection = await connectionManager.getConnection();

  try {
    // Step 1: [Action]
    const queryExecutor = new QueryExecutor(connection);

    // Step 2: [Action]
    const vertexOps = new VertexOperations(schema, queryExecutor, sqlGenerator);

    // Step 3: [Action]
    const result = await vertexOps.performMainTask();

    console.log('Task completed successfully:', result);
    return result;

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Task failed:', error);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    // Cleanup
    connection.release();
    await connectionManager.closeAll();
  }
}

// Usage
accomplishTask()
  .then(result => console.log('Success:', result))
