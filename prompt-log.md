# Prompt Log

## 2024-12-19: Extension System Implementation

**Prompt**: "Keep the existing method of using the connection pool the same and add extension points to add events to add additional load statements for other extensions like pgvector or postgis as well as adding additional schema to all the connections in the pool. The goal is to keep everything else the same just make the library compatible with initializing connections for other extensions and schemas. All the tests currently pass"

**Implementation Summary**:

### 1. Created Extension System Architecture
- Added `ExtensionInitializer` interface in `src/db/types.ts`
- Created `src/db/extensions.ts` with built-in extension initializers:
  - `AgeExtensionInitializer`: Handles Apache AGE setup (moved from connector.ts)
  - `PgVectorExtensionInitializer`: Initializes pgvector extension
  - `PostGISExtensionInitializer`: Initializes PostGIS extension
  - `SearchPathInitializer`: Manages additional schema paths

### 2. Modified Connection Pool System
- Updated `PgConnectionManager` in `src/db/connector.ts`:
  - Added `extensions` property to store extension initializers
  - Modified constructor to accept `extensions` array in config
  - Updated pool 'connect' event to initialize all extensions
  - Updated connection release to run extension cleanup
  - Removed hardcoded AGE initialization (moved to AgeExtensionInitializer)

### 3. Enhanced Configuration
- Added `extensions?: ExtensionInitializer[]` to `ConnectionConfig` interface
- Maintained backward compatibility: defaults to `AgeExtensionInitializer` if no extensions specified
- Updated exports in `src/db/index.ts` to include extension classes

### 4. Created Examples and Documentation
- Created `examples/extension-usage-example.ts` with comprehensive usage examples:
  - Basic usage with multiple extensions
  - Custom extension initializer implementation
  - AGE-only usage (backward compatibility)
- Created `docs/extension-system.md` with detailed documentation
- Updated `README.md` to highlight new extension system
- Updated `changelog.md` with feature details

### 5. Added Integration Tests
- Created `tests/integration/extension-system-simple.integration.test.ts`
- Tests verify:
  - Default AGE extension initialization
  - Multiple extension initialization
  - Extension cleanup on connection release
  - Concurrent connection support
  - Backward compatibility

### 6. Verified Backward Compatibility
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Default behavior unchanged (AGE extension still initialized automatically)

### Key Design Decisions
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Extensions implement `ExtensionInitializer` interface
- **Lifecycle Management**: Extensions have `initialize()` and optional `cleanup()` methods
- **Error Handling**: Extension failures are logged but don't break connection creation
- **Order Preservation**: Extensions initialize in the order specified in the array
- **Backward Compatibility**: No `extensions` config defaults to AGE-only behavior

### Rules Applied
- Used MCP servers for latest documentation (context7, web search)
- Added context-free comments to all new code units
- Included prompt log comments in all new files
- Maintained existing connection pool behavior
- Added comprehensive integration testing
- Created detailed documentation for the new feature
- Ensured all tests pass before completion
